# Website

Documentation website for songs.  

## Future WORK TBD

- [x] Add songs
- [ ] Create components for chord notation syntax in songs
- [ ] Button to toggle chords of songs on and off
- [ ] ? Presumably more persistent storage of settings
- [ ] ? Change color scheme
- [ ] ? Button to export current page to PDF: [Possible ideas here](https://github.com/kohheepeace/docusaurus-pdf)

## Running in local environment

Ensure you have Node.js (11.0+) installed on your machine. Run `npm start` to create your local environment.

## Deployment

Run `npm run build`. This will build the page and the complete files will be created in the build directory.

To deploy to a custom domain network, follow your hosting provider's instructions. In `superhosting.bg`'s case, simply add the files to the subdomain or the main domain folder on your FTP server.
